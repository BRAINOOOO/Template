1- if i have a convex polgon the primeter of it in manhattem distance is the primeter of the rectangle a round it.

2- the primeter of a triangle in manhattem distance : Let's show that the optimal triangle uses at least 2 of the extreme points.
Imagine some optimal triangle, and its bounding rectangle. Notice that since each edge of the bounding rectangle must touch some
vertex of the triangle (it is bounding after all), and we have 4 edges and 3 vertices, then there must be some vertex of the triangle 
that touches 2 edges of the rectangle (so it coincides with a rectangle vertex). If this is the case, we know that in comparison with 
the 2 other vertices, this vertex has "extremal" X and Y coordinates (minimal/maximal X, and minimal/maximal Y). Without loss of 
generality, assume this vertex has maximum X and Y. Then to optimize the perimeter, the other two vertices should have smallest 
possible X and smallest possible Y. We can pick these 2 vertices to be 2 of the extreme points (one with minimal X and one with minimal Y).

3- If you have queries and is a query contradicts with a pervious ones it will be neglected so you can't proceed the queries offline.
