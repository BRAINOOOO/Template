-If the root index is i then the left child is 2*i and the right child is 2*i+1 and the root is one
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-If you shift the nodes at a certain level let it br lv by S value and when every node is shifted all its subtree are shifted too that
means that every node at ith level starting from the lv level will be shifted by the a mount S and S will be multiplied by two as we 
go down.
CODE
for(ll i=lv,Sh=S;i<=61;i++,Sh*=2)
{
      ll str= power[i-1];
      ll en= power[i]-1;
      ll cnt= (en-str+1);
      levelNodeshift[i]=(levelNodeshift[i]+Sh)%cnt;
}
