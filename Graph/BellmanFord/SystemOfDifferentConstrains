prerequisites
1- a+b < c =  a+b <= c-1.  
2- a+b > c =  a+b >= c+1.
3- s<= a+b <= e =  a+b <= e and a+b >= s.
4- a+b <= c =  a <= c-b   ( rearranging the enquality equation doesn't change the enquality sign )
5- a-b >= s = b-a <= -s   ( multipling the enquality equation with -1 in both sides reverse the enquality sign,
   from > to <
   from < to >
   from >= to <=

System Of Different constrains: means i am having some variables and i want to assign values to those variables in such a way that 
some constrains must be occured for example if i have an array X of elements x1,x2,x3 and i want to assign the values of the array 
in such a way that x1+x2 >= a and x2+x3 >= b and x1+x3 >=c.
Task: is to know whether there is a way to assign values to the variables to satisifty the constrains and if so what is the values for
the variables ( note there may be alot of valid solutions we just want one example of them ).
Solution: first all the equations must have only two parameters(a,c) and in the form a+c >= d 
(where a,d are variables and c is constant )so you have to rearrange all the equations
to be in that form, second imagine that the equations as a graph and each equation is a weighted 
edge for example a+c >= d is an edge from a to d with the weight c which means to reach d from a
you have to add the value of weight which is c, okay this graph is called constraint graph after
building it how could i know if there is a valid solution or not, okay first imagine i am having
variables a,b,c,d and constants c1,c2,c3 where i am having edge(from,to,weight) edge(a,b,c1),edge(b,c,c2),edge(c,d,c3) if i put a=0
then b <= c1 let b=c1 then c<= c1+c2 let c=c1+c2 then d<=c1+c2+c3 let d=c1+c2+c3 this is a valid possible solution, observe that
the value of each variable can be the weight of the path to it starting from a so from here if the variables for a non-cyclic 
behaviour then there can be a solution, Now if i have a cycle edge(a,b,c1),edge(b,c,c2),edge(c,d,c3),edge(d,a,c4) now every variable 
participate in 2 equations, b-a <= c1, c-b <= c2, d-c <= c3, a-d <= c4 (note a+b >= c can be written as c-a <= b) if i sum up the 
equations left hand side= b-a+c-b+d-c+a-d = 0 , right hand side c1+c2+c3+c4 if the total value of cycle weights is -ve then there 
will be no answer else there will an answer, but how to assign the values okay if i have edge(x1,x2,c1),edge(x2,x3,c2) then
from first edge x2 <= x1+c1, from second edge x2 >= x3-c2, okay the second edge will accept the value of x2 to be very high but the 
first edge puts a limit that it have to be at most x1+c1 so i will get the min path from a node to x2 and that will be my limit and
can be my value and the same for the rest of nodes, but how could i get the min path among all the nodes to a certain node here
there is a trick put an extra node and connect it to all the nodes for weight equals to zero then the min path from that node
to my node will be the answer i want.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
1- build the constraint graph.
2- put the Extra node and connect it to all the nodes for weight zero.
3- run bellmanford or SPFA and see if there is -ve cycle then there is no answer else there is a solution.
4- to assign valid values to the variables every variable value is the shortest distance from the extra node to it.
