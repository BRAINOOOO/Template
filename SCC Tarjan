Some definations

-SCC ( Strongly connected components )
a SC component means that each pair of nodes in it can reach each other.

-SCG ( Strongly connected graph )
if all the graph nodes are part of SCC ( in other words all the graph represents one SCC )
to Test SCG 
run dfs from a certain node if it get all the nodes run dfs again from the same node but on the transpose of the graph if it gets all the
nodes so its SCG

-Graph Transpose
graph transpose of a certain graph is by inverting the direction of all the edges in that graph
Note
the graph and its transpose have the same number of SCCs

-DFS Number
is when you traverse the graph with dfs when you entering a new node put a number to it 

-Lowest Link Number
it is the dfs number of the farest ancestor of my current node
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-SCC In  undirected graph
so simpliy start dfs from each unvisited node and count
CODE
for(int i=1;i<=nodes;i++)
{
    if(!vis[i])
    {
        dfs(i);
        cnt++;
    }
}
// cnt is the number of the connected compontents.
// to get the nodes in each compontent just put the nodes you visited in each dfs call 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-SCC In directed graph
-it can be with floyed at complexity ( n^3 )
-OR with Tarjan with complexity (nlogn)

Tarjan algorithsm 
he put the dfs number to each new node he visits and if it is an already visited node so it may be one of 2 cases whether it is one of
my ancestors in my tree or it belongs to an old other tree if its my ancestor so i will minmize my lowest link number with its dfs 
number intially i will set the dfs number equal to the lowest link number else ignore it.
